  "prompt": "Create a 3D model of gold-toned eyewear with a polished nickel-titanium alloy frame (PBR roughness: 0.4, metallic: 1.0) featuring subtle surface micro-scratches and tooling marks. Model hexagonal polycarbonate lenses (refractive index: 1.49, ABBE \u226530) as fully transparent (color intensity 0.0) with anti-reflective, scratch-resistant coatings, 100% UV protection, and 0.5mm matte bevel edges. Set frame measurements to narrow:128mm, medium:131mm, wide:138mm. Include silicone nose pads (medical-grade Shore 50A) and hidden 3-5 barrel hinges (M1.4\u00d73mm screws, 500-700gf spring tension). Maintain geometric accuracy with 45\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 views for bridge curvature (\u00b10.2mm tolerance), temple taper gradients, and lens edge thickness. Ensure no branding elements, consistent gold tone (\u0394E <2.0), and 0.1mm feature resolution. Prioritize optical clarity with zero tint gradient and polished frame reflectivity matching the visual analysis.\n\nImage URLs: ['https://i.warbycdn.com/s/c/7c0fd8dfb6817586c87a4d4035012f3621480728', 'https://i.warbycdn.com/s/c/e26eef48218e1b762ce4d8e9e617ab19835b2cf5']",
