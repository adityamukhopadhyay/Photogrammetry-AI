The eyeglasses are a rectangular frame style, featuring a translucent olive-green acetate material.  The frame material appears to be a single layer of acetate, exhibiting a smooth, slightly glossy surface finish.  The tortoiseshell-colored temples contrast with the green frame.  The "Warby Parker" branding is subtly etched into the inside of the left temple, approximately 10mm from the hinge, in an embossed, capital lettering style.  The lenses appear clear and have no visible tint gradient or reflective coating.  The hinges seem to be a traditional type, likely a metal barrel hinge, with small visible rivets on the frame. No adjustable nose pads or cable temple tips are discernible.  Precise measurements and material properties are not available from the image alone.
