The image shows a pair of black-framed eyeglasses with a gold-colored metal rim.  The frames appear to be made of acetate, with a matte finish.  The temple arms are a uniform black color.  The brand name "Warby Parker" is embossed on the inside of the left temple arm, approximately 10mm from the hinge.  The lenses are clear and appear to have no tint gradient or reflectivity.  The hinges appear to be a traditional metal hinge type, and there are small, round rivets on the sides of the frame.  No adjustable nose pads, cable temple tips, or hidden spring mechanisms are visible.  Precise measurements and material specifications are not possible from this image alone.
