Create a 3D model of a pair of black-framed eyeglasses with a gold-colored metal rim, based on the given specifications and visual analysis of the glasses (material='hand-polished cellulose acetate and stainless steel' lens_type='Polycarbonate lenses' measurements={'Medium': 136, 'Wide': 142, 'Medium Wide': 136} branding=['Warby Parker'] features=['Anti-reflective and scratch-resistant lens coatings', 'Blocks 100% of UV rays', 'Browline construction'] roughness=0.4 metallic=0.5 ior=1.49 and The image shows a pair of black-framed eyeglasses with a gold-colored metal rim. The frames appear to be made of acetate, with a matte finish. The temple arms are a uniform black color. The brand name "Warby Parker" is embossed on the inside of the left temple arm, approximately 10mm from the hinge. The lenses are clear and appear to have no tint gradient or reflectivity. The hinges appear to be a traditional metal hinge type, and there are small, round rivets on the sides of the frame. No adjustable nose pads, cable temple tips, or hidden spring mechanisms are visible. Precise measurements and material specifications are not possible from this image alone).  

Ensure the frame is made of hand-polished cellulose acetate with a matte finish (PBR roughness: 0.4, metallic: 0.5) and includes a gold-colored stainless steel rim. Model the temple arms as uniform black acetate with a smooth surface finish.  

Include "Warby Parker" branding etched onto the inside of the left temple arm, positioned precisely 10mm from the hinge centerpoint, with debossed engraving details (0.3mm depth, sans-serif font, 2.5mm height, 3° radial offset to follow temple curvature).  

Model the lenses as clear polycarbonate with anti-reflective and scratch-resistant coatings, ensuring full UV protection. Set the refractive index to 1.49 and include a 0.5mm matte bevel edge polish.  

Incorporate small, round rivets on the sides of the frame with a polished finish (PBR metallic: 0.8, roughness: 0.1). Add traditional metal hinges with 3-5 barrel components, spring tension of 500-700gf, and M1.4×3mm flathead screws.  

Ensure the frame measurements are accurate: Medium (136mm), Wide (142mm), and Medium Wide (136mm). Maintain the browline construction with precise bridge curvature radius (±0.2mm tolerance) and temple arm taper gradient.  

Prevent texture UV stretching, color value mismatches (ΔE < 2.0), edge detailing errors (0.1mm feature resolution), and surface normal inconsistencies between views. Ensure the model reflects the matte finish of the acetate and the polished metal rim accurately.
