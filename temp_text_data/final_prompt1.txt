Create a 3D model of a pair of brown-toned eyeglasses with a frame made of hand-polished cellulose acetate, exhibiting a marbled pattern with varying shades of brown and a smooth, glossy finish (PBR roughness: 0.4, metallic: 0.0). The lenses should be clear polycarbonate with anti-reflective and scratch-resistant coatings, ensuring 100% UV ray blocking, and a refractive index of 1.49. Set the frame width measurements to 134mm for medium and 138mm for wide, maintaining precise geometric alignment across front (0°) and angled (45°) views, including bridge curvature radius (±0.2mm tolerance), temple arm taper gradient, and lens bevel angle (edge thickness profile).  

Include "Warby Parker" branding etched onto the right temple, positioned 10mm from the hinge centerpoint, with printed engraving details (sans-serif font, 2.5mm height, following temple curvature with a 3° radial offset). Add graduated rivets on the temples for structural support, ensuring a polished finish (PBR metallic: 0.0, roughness: 0.4).  

Model the hinge as a standard barrel hinge with 3-5 components, spring tension of 500-700gf, and M1.4×3mm flathead screws. Nose pads should be integrated into the acetate frame design without additional adjustability.  

Ensure the lens optical properties include a base curve within the 4-8 diopter range, an ABBE value ≥30, and a 0.5mm matte bevel edge polish. Maintain consistency in surface normal alignment and prevent texture UV stretching, color value mismatches (ΔE < 2.0), and edge detailing errors (0.1mm feature resolution).  

Reflect the oversized lens design, handsome brow bar, and smooth, glossy surface finish throughout the model, emphasizing brand identity and mechanical accuracy.
