The eyewear is a pair of brown-toned eyeglasses.  The frames appear to be made of acetate, exhibiting a marbled pattern with varying brown tones.  The surface finish appears to be smooth and glossy.  The "Warby Parker" branding is inscribed on the right temple, positioned approximately 10mm from the hinge. The engraving style appears to be printed. The lenses are clear with no visible tint gradient.  There are small rivets on the temples, likely for structural support, but no specific material or count can be identified.  The hinge type is a standard barrel hinge. The image lacks detail to specify precise measurements, material thickness variations, or lens surface properties like reflectivity.
