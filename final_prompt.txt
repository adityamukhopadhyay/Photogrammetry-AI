Create a 3D model of rectangular eyeglasses with a hand-polished cellulose acetate frame (roughness: 0.4, metallic: 0.0) in translucent olive-green, featuring tortoiseshell-colored temples. Model the frame as a single-layer acetate construction with smooth surface finish and micro-scratch/texturing maps for natural tooling marks. Use polycarbonate lenses (refractive index: 1.49) with crystal-clear transparency (0.0 color intensity), anti-reflective coating, and 0.5mm matte edge bevel. Implement a 133mm frame width with precise bridge curvature (radius ±0.2mm tolerance) and temple arm taper gradient matching 45°/0° reference views. Etch "WARBY PARKER" on the left temple interior: 10mm from hinge center, 2.5mm sans-serif capitals debossed 0.3mm deep with 3° radial curvature alignment. Include 3-5 barrel metal hinges (M1.4×3mm screws, 600gf spring tension) and graduated rivet details. Ensure UV-blocking lenses with scratch-resistant treatment and maintain 100% transparency (no tint gradient). Prevent surface normal errors and enforce 0.1mm feature resolution for frame edges. Model medical-grade silicone nose pads (Shore 50A) integrated into the acetate frame. Validate inter-pupillary alignment between views and eliminate texture stretching (ΔE <2.0 color accuracy).
