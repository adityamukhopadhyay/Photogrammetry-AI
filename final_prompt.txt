Create a 3D model of gold-toned eyewear with a polished nickel-titanium alloy frame (PBR roughness: 0.4, metallic: 1.0) featuring subtle surface micro-scratches and tooling marks. Model hexagonal polycarbonate lenses (refractive index: 1.49, ABBE ≥30) as fully transparent (color intensity 0.0) with anti-reflective, scratch-resistant coatings, 100% UV protection, and 0.5mm matte bevel edges. Set frame measurements to narrow:128mm, medium:131mm, wide:138mm. Include silicone nose pads (medical-grade Shore 50A) and hidden 3-5 barrel hinges (M1.4×3mm screws, 500-700gf spring tension). Maintain geometric accuracy with 45° and 0° views for bridge curvature (±0.2mm tolerance), temple taper gradients, and lens edge thickness. Ensure no branding elements, consistent gold tone (ΔE <2.0), and 0.1mm feature resolution. Prioritize optical clarity with zero tint gradient and polished frame reflectivity matching the visual analysis.
