Create a 3D model of a pair of glasses based on the given specifications and visual analysis of the glasses.  

1. Material Properties:  
- Frame material: Hand-polished cellulose acetate with a marbled brown tone pattern.  
- Surface finish: Smooth and glossy.  
- PBR values: Roughness = 0.4, Metallic = 0.0.  
- Include subtle surface imperfection maps (micro-scratches, tooling marks) for realism.  

2. Geometric Requirements:  
- Frame measurements: Medium = 134mm, Wide = 138mm, Medium Wide = 134mm.  
- Bridge curvature radius: ±0.2mm tolerance.  
- Temple arm taper gradient: Gradual and consistent.  
- Lens bevel angle: Edge thickness profile to match oversized lenses.  
- Maintain inter-pupillary distance alignment between front (0°) and angled (45°) views.  

3. Branding Implementation:  
- Etch "WARBY PARKER" text on the right temple:  
  - Position: 10mm from hinge centerpoint.  
  - Engraving: Printed style, 0.3mm depth debossed.  
  - Font: Sans-serif, 2.5mm height.  
  - Alignment: Follow temple curvature (3° radial offset).  
- Include graduated rivets on temples for structural support.  

4. Optical Requirements:  
- Lens material: Polycarbonate.  
- Lens parameters:  
  - Refractive index (IOR): 1.49.  
  - Anti-reflective and scratch-resistant coatings.  
  - 100% UV ray blocking.  
  - Edge polish: 0.5mm matte bevel.  
- Lenses: Clear with no visible tint gradient.  

5. Mechanical Components:  
- Hinge type: Standard barrel hinge.  
  - Barrel count: 3-5 components.  
  - Spring tension: 500-700gf.  
  - Screw type: M1.4×3mm flathead.  
- Nose pad material: Medical-grade silicone (Shore 50A).  

6. Quality Assurance:  
- Prevent texture UV stretching and color value mismatches (ΔE < 2.0).  
- Maintain edge detailing accuracy (0.1mm feature resolution).  
- Ensure surface normal consistency between front and angled views.  
- Avoid surface normal inconsistencies and edge detailing errors.  

The final model should accurately reflect the physical properties, material finishes, and branding elements while adhering to the specified optical and mechanical requirements.
