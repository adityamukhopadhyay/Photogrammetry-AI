Create a 3D model of gold-toned eyewear with a polished nickel-titanium alloy memory metal frame (PBR roughness: 0.4, metallic: 1.0) and crystal-clear hexagonal polycarbonate lenses. Frame measurements: narrow 128mm, medium 131mm, wide 138mm. Model lenses as fully transparent (color intensity 0.0) with anti-reflective, scratch-resistant coatings and 100% UV protection (refractive index: 1.49). Include subtle surface micro-scratches on metal surfaces using imperfection maps. Integrate silicone nose pads (Shore 50A) and hidden 3-component barrel hinges with M1.4×3mm screws. Maintain precise bridge curvature (±0.2mm tolerance) and temple taper matching reference images. Ensure lens edges have 0.5mm matte bevels with no tint gradient. Exclude all branding elements per visual analysis. Prevent UV stretching artifacts and maintain 0.1mm feature resolution. Prioritize image-based proportions for frame thickness and hinge visibility.
